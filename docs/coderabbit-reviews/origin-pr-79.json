Path correctly updated.**\n\nThe Store learning script path has been correctly updated to reflect its new location in the `core/` subdirectory.\n\n---\n\n`24-24`: The documentation paths are correct. The `recall_temporal_facts.py` script exists at `opc/scripts/recall_temporal_facts.py` and does not require updating. While other recall-related utilities (`recall_learnings.py`, `store_learning.py`) have been moved to `opc/scripts/core/`, the temporal facts script remains in the root scripts directory.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/help/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`168-168`: **LGTM! Path update is consistent.**\n\nThe script path update is correct and consistent with the same change in `.claude/skills/recall/SKILL.md`. The command syntax using a subshell is valid and achieves the same result as the approach used in the recall skill.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/recall-reasoning/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`35-35`: **Path is correct—no changes needed.**\n\nThe script `search-reasoning.sh` exists at `.claude/scripts/` and remains valid. Since this is a bash script (not Python), it was intentionally left in its original location while Python scripts were moved to `mcp/` and `core/` subdirectories.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/nia-docs/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`15-15`: **Script path is incorrect — referenced location does not exist.**\n\nThe script exists at `opc/scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py`, not `scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py`. All seven command examples in SKILL.md reference the incorrect path and will fail when executed. Update all seven examples (lines 15, 21, 27, 33, 52, 56, 60) to reference `opc/scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py` instead.\n\n\n\n> Likely an incorrect or invalid review comment.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/perplexity-search/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`31-105`: **LGTM! All perplexity_search.py references correctly updated.**\n\nAll nine occurrences of the script path have been consistently updated from `scripts/perplexity_search.py` to `scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py` across all usage modes (ask, search, research, reason, deep) and examples.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/research-external/SKILL.md (4)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`167-176`: **LGTM! Library focus paths correctly updated.**\n\nBoth `nia_docs.py` script references in the library focus section have been properly updated to `scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py`.\n\n---\n\n`179-181`: **LGTM! Firecrawl path correctly updated.**\n\nThe `firecrawl_scrape.py` script path has been properly updated to `scripts/mcp/firecrawl_scrape.py`.\n\n---\n\n`195-216`: **LGTM! Best-practices focus paths correctly updated.**\n\nAll five `perplexity_search.py` script references in the best-practices section (both normal and thorough depth) have been consistently updated to `scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py`.\n\n---\n\n`225-240`: **LGTM! General focus paths correctly updated.**\n\nAll three MCP tool script paths in the general focus section have been properly updated:\n- `nia_docs.py` → `scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py`\n- `perplexity_search.py` → `scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py`  \n- `firecrawl_scrape.py` → `scripts/mcp/firecrawl_scrape.py`\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/research-agent/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`35-51`: **Script paths reference non-existent directory; verification fails.**\n\nThe documented paths (`scripts/mcp/nia_docs.py`, `scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py`, `scripts/mcp/firecrawl_scrape.py`) reference a `scripts/mcp/` directory that does not exist at the repository root. Actual script locations are `.claude/servers/` (firecrawl and perplexity) and `opc/scripts/mcp/` (nia_docs, perplexity_search, firecrawl_scrape). Update SKILL.md with the correct paths or verify the intended script organization.\n\n\n\n> Likely an incorrect or invalid review comment.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit for review status -->",
