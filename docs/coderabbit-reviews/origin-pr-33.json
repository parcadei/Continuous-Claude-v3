update SKILL.md accordingly and ensure the Iteration Rules still\npoint to valid resources.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/explore/SKILL.md:\n- Line 13: The fenced code block showing bash usage examples is missing a\nlanguage specifier; update the triple-backtick fence before the block to include\n\"bash\" so it reads ```bash and keep the closing ``` unchanged, ensuring the\nexamples (/explore, /explore <path>, /explore <pattern>) are recognized as bash\nfor linting and syntax highlighting.\n- Around line 79-82: The SKILL.md contains dangling references to\nref/search-patterns.md and ref/architecture.md; either create those two files\nunder .claude/skills/explore/ref with the expected content (search patterns and\narchitecture checklist) and commit them, or remove the two reference lines in\nSKILL.md (the \"For search patterns: `cat ref/search-patterns.md`\" and \"For\narchitecture checklists: `cat ref/architecture.md`\" lines) so they no longer\npoint to non-existent files; update SKILL.md accordingly and ensure any README\nor index links are consistent with the change.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/fix/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 13-20: The code block in SKILL.md starting with \"/fix <scope>\n[options] [description]\" lacks a language identifier; update the opening fence\nto include a language (e.g., change \"```\" to \"```bash\") so the usage examples\nlike \"/fix\", \"/fix bug\", \"/fix hook\", etc., are syntax-highlighted and clearer.\n- Around line 58-61: The SKILL.md References section points to three files but\nonly workflows.md exists; either create the missing documentation files\n(.claude/skills/fix/ref/question-flow.md and .claude/skills/fix/ref/handoff.md)\nwith the promised content or remove the invalid reference lines from\n.claude/skills/fix/SKILL.md; update the References block so it only lists\nexisting files (e.g., keep \"cat ref/workflows.md\") and add new markdown files\nwith appropriate headings and content if you choose to create the missing docs.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/help/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 20-55: The help file .claude/skills/help/SKILL.md incorrectly\nreferences the nonexistent skill `/create_plan`; remove the `/create_plan` entry\nfrom the \"Planning & Research\" list (or replace it with the correct existing\nskill name if this functionality was consolidated elsewhere) so the listed\ncommands match actual .claude/skills/* SKILL.md files; update the single line\nthat currently reads \"`/create_plan` - Create implementation plan from\nrequirements\" accordingly and ensure spacing/ordering remains consistent.\n- Around line 65-67: The SKILL.md document references missing files\nref/skill-list.md and ref/creating-skills.md; fix by either adding a new ref/\ndirectory next to .claude/skills/help/ containing skill-list.md and\ncreating-skills.md with the appropriate contents, or remove/update the reference\nlines in .claude/skills/help/SKILL.md so they no longer point to non-existent\nfiles; ensure the change targets the reference text mentioning\n`ref/skill-list.md` and `ref/creating-skills.md` in SKILL.md.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/implement_task/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 51-56: Update the fenced code block in SKILL.md to include a\nlanguage identifier (e.g., use ```text or ```markdown) so the example is\nlint-compliant; locate the block showing \"Task [N] Complete / Status:\n[success/partial/blocked] / Handoff: [path] / Summary: [1-2 sentences]\" and\nprepend the fence with a language token (for example change ``` to ```text)\nleaving the block contents unchanged and close with the existing ``` fence.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/plan-agent/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 14-16: The fenced code block showing the usage example for the\nplan-agent command lacks a language specifier; update the code fence that\ncontains \"/plan-agent [description or ticket reference]\" to use a bash language\nidentifier (i.e., change ``` to ```bash) so linting and syntax highlighting\nrecognize it.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/premortem/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 13-16: Update the usage code block in SKILL.md to specify the\nshell language so syntax highlighting is clear: change the opening fence from\n``` to ```bash for the block containing \"/premortem              # Full\nanalysis\" and \"/premortem quick        # Fast check before implementation\",\nleaving the content and closing fence unchanged.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/research/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 58-60: The SKILL.md references a non-existent file\n(ref/agents.md); either create ref/agents.md with the expected content or remove\nthe reference invocation (`cat ref/agents.md`) from\n.claude/skills/research/SKILL.md; if creating the file, follow the style of\nref/research-template.md so the command `cat ref/agents.md` runs without error\nand contains the agent documentation required by the skill.\n\nIn @.claude/skills/tdd/ref/test-patterns.md:\n- Around line 95-100: Update the fenced code block that contains the directory\ntree starting with \"tests/\" so it includes a language identifier (e.g., add\n\"text\" after the opening ```). Locate the markdown block that shows the tree\nwith \"tests/ ├── unit/ ├── integration/ └── e2e/\" and change the opening fence\nto ```text to mark it as plain text (or use an appropriate alternative markdown\nformatting for directory structures).\n\nIn @.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md:\n- Around line 50-57: Update the fenced code block containing the test naming\nexamples to include a language specifier (e.g., change the opening triple\nbackticks to \"```text\" or \"```plaintext\") so the block like the one showing\n\"test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected>\" and the example lines\n(\"test_login_valid_credentials_returns_token\", etc.) is consistently\nhighlighted/parsed.\n- Around line 72-75: The SKILL.md References section mentions ref/frameworks.md\nwhich doesn't exist; create a new file named ref/frameworks.md (or if the\nreference is incorrect remove the reference from .claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md) —\nif creating the file, add a concise framework guide that lists supported\nframeworks, quick setup steps, common test/runner commands, configuration\nexamples, and any repo-specific conventions so the reference resolves and\ndevelopers can follow framework setup from SKILL.md.\n````\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>🧹 Nitpick comments (4)</summary><blockquote>\n\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/fix/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`1-5`: **Consider adding `user-invocable: true` flag.**\n\nThe corresponding `premortem/SKILL.md` file (line 4) includes `user-invocable: true`, which signals that the skill is intended for direct user invocation.

The dual timestamp approach (ISO for dynamic fields, date-only for tracking) is pragmatic and clearly labeled.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/hook-developer/ref/schemas.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`1-155`: **Comprehensive hook schemas with strong critical callouts.**\n\nThe schemas cover all documented hook events and highlight two important behavioral safeguards (tool_response field naming at line 49 and stop_hook_active check at line 130). The JSON structures are valid and the input fields are well-documented.\n\nMinor observations:\n\n- **UserPromptSubmit output (lines 60–71):** The output description only mentions \"Plain text stdout added to context, or JSON with `{\"decision\": \"block\", \"reason\": \"...\"}`\". This is brief; consider clarifying the default behavior when no JSON output is provided.\n- **PostToolUse output (lines 52–58):** The output schema is minimal (decision, reason, hookSpecificOutput). Verify this is intentionally simpler than PreToolUse.\n- **CLAUDE_ENV_FILE reference (line 106):** Useful guidance, but no detail on format or lifecycle. This is fine for a reference doc, as it assumes the skill SKILL.md covers implementation details.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.claude/skills/help/SKILL.md (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`1-5`: **Confirm frontmatter changes maintain skill discoverability.**\n\nThe frontmatter was simplified by removing `triggers`, `allowed-tools`, and `priority` fields.

The addition of quick mode provides valuable time-saving alternative, and the risk summary template is practical.\n\nThe condensed format aligns well with the PR's progressive-disclosure goal: users get the essential workflow in SKILL.md and can reference detailed templates/categories as needed.\n\n---\n\n`84-87`: **Verify that all referenced `/ref/` files exist and are discoverable.**\n\nLines 86–87 reference two external files: `ref/premortem-template.md` and `ref/risk-categories.md`.
